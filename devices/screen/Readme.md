Controller firmware for a no-name screen.
 
The screen has a clockwise/anticlockwise motor which is controlled by a PIC. On pressing a button, one of the two relays
is closed and the motor moves the screen. A ESP-01s is attached to short-circuit the buttons via optocouplers to
emulating pressing the button.
